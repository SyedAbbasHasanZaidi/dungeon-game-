Week 6
In this week me and Abbas spent our time resding through the spec and undestanding how we would roughly go through each task together and how we should split up tasks.

Week 7
This week we split up the tasks such that we would have equal responsibility over the number of tasks.
I ended up doing part b c d and e while Abbas attended help sessions to clarify our understanding and better answer part d and b which we struggled with. Abbas on the other hand did part (a) and (f)
 
Week 8
I did the code changes for parts b d and e as seen in the merge [harish/pair-blogging](https://nw-syd-gitlab.cseunsw.tech/COMP2511/23T3/teams/F09A_BIDOOF/assignment-ii/-/merge_requests/6/diffs) this allowed me to refactor the goals package such that the code followed similar conventions to those in my lab07 submission. I also wrote the blogging by rewriting our raw blogging text from our google doc into the md file.

Week 9
In week 9 I tackled Task 2: in which i did part (a) and part (c).
I started doing part (a) by assesing which packages to refactor and how i could make a design that was free of code smells. Extended upon my goals package refactoring in part (e) to create the functionality for enemyGoal.
